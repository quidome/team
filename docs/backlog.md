# Backlog

Open work, most important first. Changes link to their folder; small fixes are one line.

1. [Games from the game list](changes/2026-10-10-games-from-game-list/) – implement (epic, 5 stories; story 1: the base)
   - [The base](changes/2026-10-10-the-base/) – implement (story 1; steps 0–4 done, v0.1.0 released; build review after the pipeline)

Small:
- Delete the untested images `sha-a9b5906` and `sha-a9b5906-migration` from GHCR (needs `gh auth refresh -s read:packages,delete:packages`, or the GitHub web page). Until then, do not tag commit `a9b5906`. Decision 0010 says they were deleted; that is true only after this.
